I am happy to announce that I will be participating as a panelist at the
upcoming [CENGN Summit](https://cengnsummit.ca/) in Ottawa on November 27th.
[CENGN](https://www.cengn.ca/) is an amazing organization and their mission is
to accelerate the growth of the Canadian Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) sector, enabling economic strength and prosperity, as well as
innovation and competitiveness in this high-growth global multi-trillion dollar
industry.  

The panel discussion is titled: ["Business in a Hyper-Connected World"](https://cengnsummit.ca/panel-1-2018/)
here is the panel description from the CENGN Summit website:

> > The world is in a state of transformation, with technological advancements
changing how we conduct business and live our lives every day.
Hyper-connectivity, insatiable bandwidth demands, and warp-speed technology
evolution is challenging the global and Canadian ICT industry to build
strategies and business models that ensure both their relevance in today’s
world but also the flexibility to adapt with the changing tech sector, and be a
driving force in the industry’s transformation. This panel will discuss how
advancements in the networking industry is changing the business landscape for
ICT driven organizations. It will also explore how tech business decision makers
and policy-makers can position themselves to take advantage of the opportunities
that are present in ICT, as well as avoid being left stagnant as new challenges
appear.

On the panel with me are representatives from some great Canadian ICT companies

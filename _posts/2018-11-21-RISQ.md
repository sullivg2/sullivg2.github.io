Next week I will be presenting a talk at the annual [Réseau D'informations
Scientifiques Du Québec (Risq)](http://colloque.risq.quebec)conference in
Montreal. RISQ is Quebec's education and research network that connects 21
universities, 22 colleges and 2,316 K-12 schools to the national
[Canarie](https://www.canarie.ca/) network.

The main focus of this years conference is cybersecurity, research in the field
and its application while ensuring to take different postures to understand the
field.

I've chosen to present an IoT security talk, specifically about securing
IoT devices at scale leveraging behavioral analysis and unsupervised machine
learning. The talk is called "What Nature can Tell us about IoT Security at
Scale" and it compares IoT devices to flocks of birds. Just as birds of the same
species flock together, so do devices of the same kind. We can apply this theory
to categorize IoT devices and their behaviors and we can begin to benchmark what
is expected behavior, and what is anomaly.

Pending corporate approval, I will post my deck afterwards.

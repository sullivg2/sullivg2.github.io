This week I presented a talk at the annual [Réseau D'informations
Scientifiques Du Québec (Risq)](http://colloque.risq.quebec)conference in
Montreal. RISQ is Quebec's education and research network that connects 21
universities, 22 colleges and 2,316 K-12 schools to the national
[Canarie](https://www.canarie.ca/) network.

The main focus of this year's conference is cybersecurity, research in the field
and its application while ensuring to take different postures to understand the
field.

I chose to present an IoT security talk, specifically about securing
IoT devices at scale leveraging behavioral analysis and cluster analysis, a form
of unsupervised machine learning. The talk is called "What Nature can Tell us
about IoT Security at Scale" and it uses the analogy of  IoT devices to flocks
of birds. Just as birds of the same species flock together, so do devices of
the same kind. We can apply this theory to categorize IoT devices and their
behaviors and we can begin to benchmark what is expected behavior, and what is
anomaly.

The deck ended up being highly visual, and therefore might not be worth posting.
If a recording on the presentation ever surfaces, I'll be sure to provide a link
here.

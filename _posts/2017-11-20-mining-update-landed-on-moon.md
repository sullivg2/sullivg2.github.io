This week we finally received our first shipment of ASIC-based miners, the
FutureBit Moonlander 2: "The Most Powerful and Efficient USB Stick Miner on the
planet!". These are the first devices that our club will put into production to
mine Litecoin (LTC.)

In our [Mining 101](https://cryptonoob.club/docs/cryptocurrency-mining-101)
doc, we discuss the different kinds of miners that are available on the market
and the differences between them. Different cryptocurrencies require different
mining hardware technology. In the case of Litecoin, it requires script mining
devices. The Moonlander 2s ASIC-based design will allow the club to mine
Litecoin in the most power efficient way possible.

For those interested, here are the specs for the Moonlander 2 via
[Bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2125643.0):

- 3mh to 5.5mh scrypt performance per miner
- Core clock from 500mhz to nearly 1GHz.
- Fully customizable core voltage range from .6 - 1v, as well as adjustable memory voltage.
- Fully redesigned 5v->core voltage stage with about 95% efficiency.
- Heavy duty/over spec-ed parts were used to ensure wide range of operation.
- Custom heatsink design, and the first USB miner to feature a built in 25mm Fan.
- Status LEDs for power, TX and RX transmission.

The Moonlander 2 is over 4x the speed, over 5x the efficiency, and nearly 5x
the profitability of its predecessor, the Moonlander. The original Moonlander
was yielding about $2 USD a month, this stick is doing almost $10 per month at
current price/difficulty). This beats out any other stick miner whether script
or any other algo!

## Introducing Speculative Mining

Earlier in our club communications we referenced that we were researching the
feasibility of doing some speculative mining to reduce risk and increase
flexibility through mining diversification. We moved ahead and acquired the
club’s first GPU - the [Sapphire NITRO+ RX 580](http://sapphirenitro.sapphiretech.com/en/580-LE.html).

Originally designed for gaming, this AMD Polaris GPU will allow the club to
mine additional cryptocurrencies like [Monero](https://getmonero.org/)
and [Monacoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monacoin/) as two examples.

While our Moonlander 2s will mine Litecoin for the foreseeable future, we plan
on switching up the cryptocurrencies we mine with the GPU depending on mining
difficulty and market performance. Club members will be able to withdraw our
GPU mined cryptocurrencies the same way they would with Litecoin.

As well, we plan to allow users who exclusively want to maintain Litecoin
balances the ability to convert their speculatively mined altcoins into
Litecoin at month's end.

## Next Steps

Over the holidays our team will be tweaking the performance of our miners,
ensuring that we get an optimal performance/efficiency ratio. We will also be
setting up the devices in the data center to perform our first round of
testing. After testing we will be full-steam ahead! Stay tuned for more
communications from our team as we progress.

Happy holidays,

The Crypto Noob Team

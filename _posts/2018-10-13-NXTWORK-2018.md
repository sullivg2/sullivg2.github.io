This past week I headed to Las Vegas for Juniper Network's annual customer
summit, [NXTWORK](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/dm/nxtwork-amer-2018/). Over
1,000 Juniper customers and partners headed to Mandalay Bay for three days of
keynote presentation, technical and business breakout sessions, networking and
entertainment. A few months back I was asked to submit a talk for the business
breakout track and was fortunate to have my talk on the platform economy
accepted into the agenda.

I've been researching platform economics for the past year, so I jumped at the
opportunity to apply my learnings to the networking industry. Here is my
presentation from NXTWORK 2018.

## About Geoff

Translating the business value of technology since 2011, I am a technology
marketer and advisor who is fascinated about the business of technology, and
the technology of business. My specialty is cloud infrastructure and how it can
be leveraged to build new business models in the platform economy. My background
is in technology sales, marketing, business development, building cloud
infrastructure for platforms, and channel partners as well as some ongoing
entrepreneurial endeavors. My diverse experience has given me a unique
perspective on the enterprise and service provider technology ecosystem where
now, community, “openness” and APIs are such critical components. I'm interested
in how technology impacts business and my speciality is building and marketing highly
technical, disruptive products and services.

I'm an advocate of open source technology, having dedicated many years to
supporting the adoption of [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and other
open source projects. I currently a community ambassador for
the [Tungsten Fabric](https://tungsten.io/) community (formally OpenContrail.)

Currently, I work for [Juniper Networks](https://www.juniper.net) where I am the
head of marketing for Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America. I also am an
advisor to [Cloud-A](https://www.clouda.ca), a Canadian IaaS provider,
[Ammeris](https://www.ammeris.com), a renewables powered blockchain company and
am the co-founder of the [Crypto Noob Club](https://cryptonoob.club/), a
cryptocurrency mining co-operative for beginners.

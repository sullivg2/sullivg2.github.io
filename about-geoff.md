I am a technology marketer and advisor who is fascinated about the business of
technology, and the technology of business. My specialty is cloud infrastructure
and how it can be leveraged to build new business models in the platform
economy. My background is in technology sales, marketing, business development,
partners & alliances, and solution architecture as well as some ongoing
entrepreneurial endeavors. My diverse experience has given me a unique
perspective on the enterprise and service provider technology ecosystem
where now, community, “openness” and APIs are such critical components. I'm
interested in how technology impacts business and my speciality is building and
marketing highly technical, disruptive products and services.

## About Geoff

 I am a technology advisor who is fascinated about the business of
technology, and the technology of business. My background is in business development, marketing
, partners & alliances, and solution deisgn and architecture, all within the ICT sector. My speciality is building and bringing highly technical, disruptive products and services to market.

I'm an advocate for open source technology, having dedicated many years to
supporting the adoption of [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) and other
open source projects. I was also a community ambassador for
the [Tungsten Fabric](https://tungsten.io/) community (formally OpenContrail.)

Currently, I work for [MOBIA Technology Innovations](https://www.mobia.io) where I lead a team of some of the world's most experienced Red Hat infrastructure and software consultants. We focuse on delivering hybrid Infrastructure , automation, cloud native application platform and integration solutions for enterprise, telecom and healthcare. I also 
advise several technology startups in my spare time.

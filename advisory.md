I like to make time for side projects where I can add value and that allow me to
grow and learn as a technology and business professional. As an advisor I
describe myself as a cloud infrastructure specialist with a deep understanding
of the technology landscape. My specialty is building and marketing highly
technical infrastructure products, solutions and services to enterprises and
service providers.

## Companies

Here is a list of organizations who I actively advise for or am involved with in
some capacity:

![Meridian](/assets/images/meridiandlt.png "Meridian")

[Meridian DLT](https://meridiandlt.com/) is building an innovative green network leveraging Distributed
Ledger Technology.Powered by renewable energy nodes, the eco-system supports
many real-world DLT use cases covering green technology, carbon trading,
payments, loyalty programs, entertainment and more. I am currently a technology
advisor for Meridian DLT where I am supporting their Green Data Centre and
Blockchain-focused platform-as-a-service.

> "Our entire project felt a lift when Geoff began advising Meridian DLT, and it
really seemed like a lot of our vision started becoming integrated with real
world possibilities. Not only in bringing advanced understanding of our
infrastructure and connectivity needs, but presenting them to diverse audiences
in a way that we could build with and begin to implement." - [Matthew Pickup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-pickup-64883535/3), Co-founder & Director of Development @ [Meridian DLT](https://meridiandlt.com/)

![Cloud-A](/assets/images/cloudalogo.jpg "cloud-a")

[Cloud-A](https://www.clouda.ca) is a Canadian Infrastructure-as-a-service pioneer, and the first
Canadian company to build and operate a public cloud built with OpenStack. Their
mission is to disrupt how IT infrastructure is consumed, making it simpler
to understand and manage so that your team is more productive. They do that by
increasing visibility, insight, and the manageability of it. I actively advise
Cloud-A on business and technology related matters.

![Tungsten Fabric](/assets/images/TungstenFabric.png "Tungsten Fabric")

I am the Toronto ambassador for [Tungsten Fabric](https://tungsten.io), an open source multicloud,
multistack SDN project hosted by the Linux Foundation, where my responsibility
is to help to make Tungsten Fabric local to you. I speak at local events like
Meetups, tour some project technology, and help out locally with the community.

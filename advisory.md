## Advisory

I like to make time for side projects where I can add value and that allow me to
grow and learn as a technology and business professional. As an advisor I
describe myself as a cloud infrastructure specialist with a deep understanding
of the technology landscape. My specialty is building and marketing highly
technical infrastructure products, solutions and services to enterprises and
service providers.

## Areas of Focus

- **Technology Product/Service Go-to-market** - Product and service creation, positioning, market research, marketing & sales strategy for highly technical products and services
- **Cloud Infrastructure Advisory** -
Market analysis, financial analysis, solution architecture, vendor selection  
- **Technical Due Diligence** -
Detailed technical analysis of software and infrastructure for merger & acquisition scenarios

## Companies

Here is a list of companies who I have advised for. 

### [faastRuby](https://faastruby.io/)

I was brought on to help the founder of FaastRuby, a serverless software development platform startup create the go-to-market strategy via an open core and SaaS model. I spent 6 months helping out in many aspects of the project including marketing, business development, fundraising, and product development. in the first 6 months, the [faastRuby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/faastruby/versions/0.5.30) was downloaded over 10k times and the project won an Outstanding Performance Award at the 2019 Fukuoka Ruby Award. 

On October 1, 2019, it was [announced](https://faastruby.io/) that faastRuby would become an internal 
project at [Shopify](https://engineering.shopify.com/).

really seemed like a lot of our vision started becoming integrated with real
world possibilities. Not only in bringing advanced understanding of our

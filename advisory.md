I like to make time for side projects where I can add value and that allow me to
grow and learn as a technology and business professional. As an advisor I
describe myself as a cloud infrastructure specialist with a deep understanding
of the technology landscape. My specialty is building and marketing highly
technical infrastructure products or services.

If you would like to discuss a project with me, please send me an [email](mailto:geoff@geoffsullivan.net).

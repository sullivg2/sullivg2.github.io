> "Our entire project felt a lift when Geoff began advising Meridian DLT, and it
really seemed like a lot of our vision started becoming integrated with real
world possibilities. Not only in bringing advanced understanding of our
infrastructure and connectivity needs, but presenting them to diverse audiences
in a way that we could build with and begin to implement." - [Matthew Pickup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-pickup-64883535/3), Co-founder & Director of Development @ [Meridian DLT](https://meridiandlt.com/)

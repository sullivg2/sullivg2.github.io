> "Our entire project felt a lift when Geoff began advising Ammeris, and it
really seemed like a lot of our vision started becoming integrated with real
world possibilities. Not only in bringing advanced understanding of our
infrastructure and connectivity needs, but presenting them to diverse audiences
in a way that we could build with and begin to implement." -[Matthew Pickup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-pickup-64883535/3), Co-founder & Director of Development @ [Ammeris](https://www.ammeris.com/)
